STEPS TO FIX TAILWIND CSS STYLES
==================================

1. OPEN A NEW TERMINAL/COMMAND PROMPT
   (Don't use the one that's stuck on git push)

2. NAVIGATE TO THE PROJECT DIRECTORY:
   cd "C:\Users\Administrator\OneDrive\Documents\QMarket\qmarket"

3. INSTALL THE NEW DEPENDENCIES:
   npm install -D tailwindcss@^3.4.0 postcss autoprefixer

4. WAIT FOR INSTALLATION TO COMPLETE

5. START THE DEVELOPMENT SERVER:
   npm run dev

6. OPEN YOUR BROWSER AND GO TO:
   http://localhost:3000

WHAT I FIXED:
==============
- Downgraded from Tailwind CSS v4 (unstable) to v3 (stable)
- Updated PostCSS configuration
- Created proper Tailwind config file
- Fixed CSS imports to use @tailwind directives
- Updated package.json dependencies

Your website styles should now be working properly!
